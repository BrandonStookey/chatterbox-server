# Chatterbox-server

This is a project I completed as a student at Hack Reactor. This project was worked on with a pair. Chattterbox Server is an API server buit with node.js that replace the parse API. The server application contain some utils and routing and work with the Chatterbox client supporting all his features.

The server features at a glance :

- GET/POST/OPTIONS requests.
- Support CORS to handle cross domain issues.
- Serve Static Assets (css/html/js/img)
- Persistent storage on file.
Its architecture allows to easily extend the request handler router and add as many endpoints as needed.
